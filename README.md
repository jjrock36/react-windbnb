## Overview

![screenshot](./src/snapShot.png)

Windbnb is a responsive, mock Airbnb website built using React.js and CSS. The application is a simple design with a search/filter modal that filters by a few locations and number of guests.

Making this project took a bit longer than I wanted it to take, but I learned more about context, reusable components, filtering in React, and working with data in React.

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/paths/front-end-developer) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/0J1NxxGhOUYVqihwegfO) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.
